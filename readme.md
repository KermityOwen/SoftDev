### File-paths Clarifications:
- The player output logs will always be written to "logs".
- When the program asks for a pack, make sure your pack.txt is stored in the directory you are running from.
- To change either of these, modify the Utilities class. In doing so, also make sure to change the JUnit tests.

### How to use:
Very simple, all you need to do is to run the JAR executable and it should work.
If it does not please make sure your pack is in the correct path.
If it still does not work, then please contact me at: cwol201@exeter.ac.uk
